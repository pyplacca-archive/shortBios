                        <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> (<span>/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne</span>; German: <span>[ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn]</span>; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the <span>theory of relativity</span>, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside <span>quantum mechanics</span>). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his <span>mass–energy equivalence</span> formula E = mc^2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.
                        <br><br>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909). He subsequently realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields, and published a paper on general relativity in 1916 introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.

                        <strong>Henry Ford</strong> (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American <span>industrialist</span> and a <span>business magnate</span>, the founder of the <span>Ford Motor Company</span>, and the sponsor of the development of the <span>assembly line</span> technique of <span>mass production</span>.<br><br>
                        Although Ford did not invent the automobile or the assembly line, he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle-class Americans could afford. In doing so, Ford converted the automobile from an expensive curiosity into a practical conveyance that would profoundly impact the landscape of the 20th century. His introduction of the <span>Model T</span> automobile revolutionized transportation and American <span>industry</span>. As the owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with "<span>Fordism</span>": mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a <span>franchise</span> system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents. Ford left most of his vast wealth to the <span>Ford Foundation</span> and arranged for his family to control the company permanently.<br><br>
                        Ford was also widely known for his <span>pacifism</span> during the first years of <span>World War I</span>, and for promoting <span>antisemitic</span> content, including <em><span>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</span></em>, through his newspaper <em><span>The Dearborn Independent</span></em> and the book <em><span>The International Jew</span></em>, having an alleged influence on the development of <span>Nazism</span> and <span>Adolf Hitler</span>.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> (<span>/ˈtɛslə/</span>; Serbo-Croatian: <span>[nǐkola têsla]; Serbian Cyrillic</span>: Никола Тесла; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a <span>Serbian-American personality, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,</span> and <span>futurist</span> who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern <span>alternating current</span> (AC) <span>electricity supply</span> system.<br><br>
                        Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in <span>telephony</span> and at Continental Edison in the new <span>electric power industry</span>. He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the <span>Edison Machine Works</span> in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His <span>alternating current</span> (AC) <span>induction motor</span> and related <span>polyphase</span> AC patents, licensed by <span>Westinghouse Electric</span> in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.<br><br>
                        Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an personality and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and <span>Colorado Springs</span>. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of <span>wireless communication</span> with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished <span>Wardenclyffe Tower</span> project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.<br><br>
                        After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the <span>General Conference on Weights and Measures</span> named the <span>SI unit</span> of <span>magnetic flux density</span> the <span>tesla</span> in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.

                        <strong>Elon Reeve Musk</strong> <span>FRS</span> (<span>/ˈiːlɒn/</span>; born June 28, 1971) is an engineer, business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is a citizen of South Africa, Canada, and the United States (where he has lived most of his life and currently resides), and is the founder, CEO and chief engineer/designer of <span>SpaceX</span>; co-founder, CEO and product architect of <span>Tesla, Inc.</span>; founder of <span>The Boring Company</span>; co-founder of <span>Neuralink</span>; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of <span>OpenAI</span>. He was elected a <span>Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018</span>. In December 2016, he was ranked 21st on the <em><span>Forbes</span></em> list of <span>The World's Most Powerful People</span>, and was ranked joint first on the Forbes list of the Most Innovative Leaders of 2019. He has a net worth of $38.2 billion and is listed by Forbes as the <span>23rd-richest person in the world</span>. He is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.<br><br>
                        Born and raised in <span>Pretoria, South Africa</span>, Musk briefly attended the <span>University of Pretoria</span> before moving to <span>Canada</span> when he was 17 to attend <span>Queen's University</span>. He transferred to the <span>University of Pennsylvania</span> two years later, where he received a <span>Bachelor's degree</span> in economics from the <span>Wharton School</span> and a <span>Bachelor's degree</span> in physics from the <span>College of Arts and Sciences</span>. He began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at <span>Stanford University</span> in 1995 but dropped out after two days to pursue a business career. He subsequently co-founded <span>Zip2</span> with his brother <span>Kimbal</span>, a web software company, which was acquired by <span>Compaq</span> for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded <span>X.com</span>, an online bank. It merged with <span>Confinity</span> in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was bought by <span>eBay</span> for $1.5 billion in October 2002.<br><br>
                        In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an <span>aerospace</span> manufacturer and <span>space</span> transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined <span>Tesla, Inc.</span>, an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded, and became its CEO and product architect. In 2006, he inspired the creation of <span>SolarCity</span>, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote <span>friendly artificial intelligence</span>. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a <span>neurotechnology</span> company focused on developing <span>brain–computer interfaces</span>. In December 2016, Musk founded <span>The Boring Company</span>, an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company focused on tunnels specialized for electric vehicles.<br><br>
                        Apart from Tesla, Musk is not an investor in the stock market. In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the <span>Hyperloop</span>, and has proposed a <span>vertical take-off and landing supersonic</span> jet <span>electric aircraft</span> with electric fan propulsion, known as the Musk electric jet. Musk has said the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity. His goals include reducing <span>global warming</span> through <span>sustainable energy</span> production and consumption, and reducing the <span>risk</span> of <span>human extinction</span> by establishing a <span>human colony on Mars</span>.

                        <strong>Thomas Alva Edison</strong> (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor. He developed many devices in fields such as <span>electric power generation</span>, <span>mass communication</span>, <span>sound recording</span>, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the <span>phonograph</span>, the <span>motion picture camera</span>, and the long-lasting, practical electric <span>light bulb</span>, have had a widespread impact on the modern <span>industrialized world</span>. He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial <span>research laboratory</span>.<br><br>
                        Edison was raised in the American <span>Midwest</span>; early in his career he worked as a <span>telegraph operator</span>, which inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in <span>Menlo Park, New Jersey</span>, where many of his early inventions were developed. He later established a <span>botanic</span> laboratory in <span>Fort Myers, Florida</span> in collaboration with businessmen <span>Henry Ford</span> and <span>Harvey Firestone</span>, and a laboratory in <span>West Orange, New Jersey</span> that featured the world's first <span>film studio</span>, the <span>Black Maria</span>. He was a <span>prolific inventor</span>, holding 1,093 <span>US patents in his name</span>, as well as patents in other countries. Edison married twice and fathered six children. He died in 1931 of the complications of diabetes.

He was also a <span>naval aviator</span>, <span>test pilot</span>, and <span>university professor</span>.<br><br>
                        A graduate of <span>Purdue University</span>, Armstrong studied aeronautical engineering; his college tuition was paid for by the <span>U.S. Navy</span> under the <span>Holloway Plan</span>. He became a <span>midshipman</span> in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the <span>Korean War</span>, flying the <span>Grumman F9F Panther</span> from the <span>aircraft carrier USS Essex</span>. In September 1951, while making a low bombing run, Armstrong's aircraft was damaged when it collided with an anti-aircraft cable which cut off a large portion of one wing. Armstrong was forced to bail out. After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the <span>National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</span> (NACA) <span>High-Speed Flight Station</span> at <span>Edwards Air Force Base</span> in <span>California</span>. He was the project pilot on <span>Century Series</span> fighters and flew the <span>North American X-15</span> seven times. He was also a participant in the <span>U.S. Air Force</span>'s <span>Man in Space Soonest</span> and <span>X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight</span> programs.<br><br>
                        Armstrong joined the <span>NASA Astronaut Corps</span> in the <span>second group</span>, which was selected in 1962. He made his first <span>spaceflight</span> as command pilot of <span>Gemini 8</span> in March 1966, becoming <span>NASA</span>'s first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot <span>David Scott</span>, he performed the first <span>docking</span> of two <span>spacecraft</span>; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thruster. During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of <span>Apollo 11</span>, he had to eject from the <span>Lunar Landing Research Vehicle</span> moments before a crash.<br><br>
                        On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and <span>Apollo 11 Lunar Module</span> (LM) pilot <span>Buzz Aldrin</span> became the first people to <span>land on the Moon</span>, and the next day they spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft while <span>Michael Collins</span> remained in lunar orbit in the mission's <span>command module</span> (CM). When Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the <span>Presidential Medal of Freedom</span> by <span>President Richard Nixon</span>. President <span>Jimmy Carter</span> presented Armstrong with the <span>Congressional Space Medal of Honor</span> in 1978, and Armstrong and his former crewmates received a Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.
                        After he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the <span>University of Cincinnati</span> until 1979. He served on the <span>Apollo 13</span> accident investigation and on the <span>Rogers Commission</span>, which investigated the <span>Space Shuttle <em>Challenger</em> disaster</span>. He acted as a spokesman for several businesses and appeared in advertising for the automotive brand <span>Chrysler</span> starting in January 1979.<br><br>

                        <strong>Jeffrey Preston Bezos</strong> (<span>/ˈbeɪzoʊs/; né</span> <strong>Jorgensen</strong>; born January 12, 1964) is an American <span>internet</span> and <span>aerospace</span> entrepreneur, <span>media proprietor</span>, and investor. He is best known as the founder, chief executive officer, and president of <span>Amazon</span>. The first <span>centi-billionaire</span> on the <em>Forbes</em> wealth index, Bezos was named the "richest man in modern history" after his net worth increased to $150 billion in July 2018. In September 2018, <em>Forbes</em> described him as "far richer than anyone else on the planet" as he added $1.8 billion to his net worth when Amazon became the second company in history to reach a <span>market cap</span> of $1 trillion.<br><br>
                        Bezos was born in <span>Albuquerque, New Mexico</span>, and raised in <span>Houston, Texas</span>. He graduated from <span>Princeton University</span> in 1986 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on <span>Wall Street</span> in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. He founded the online retailer Amazon in late 1994 on a cross-country road trip from New York City to <span>Seattle</span>. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a wide variety of other <span>e-commerce</span> products and services, including video and audio streaming, <span>cloud computing</span>, and <span>artificial intelligence</span>. It is currently the world's largest <span>online sales</span> company, the largest <span>internet company by revenue</span>, as well as the world's largest provider of <span>AI assistance</span> and cloud infrastructure services through its <span>Amazon Web Services</span> arm.
                        Bezos founded the <span>aerospace manufacturer</span> and <span>sub-orbital spaceflight</span> services company Blue Origin in 2000. A <span>Blue Origin</span> test flight successfully first reached space in 2015, and the company has upcoming plans to begin commercial suborbital human spaceflight. Bezos also purchased the major American newspaper <em><span>The Washington Post</span></em> in 2013 for US$250 million in cash and manages many other investments through his venture capital firm, <span>Bezos Expeditions</span>.<br>

                    <p>
                        <strong>William Henry Gates III</strong> (born October 28, 1955) is an American <span>business magnate</span>, software developer, investor, and philanthropist. He is best known as the co-founder of <span>Microsoft Corporation</span>. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of <span>chairman</span>, <span>chief executive officer</span> (CEO), <span>president</span> and <span>chief software architect</span>, while also being the largest individual <span>shareholder</span> until May 2014. He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the <span>microcomputer revolution</span> of the 1970s and 1980s.<br><br>
                        Born and raised in <span>Seattle, Washington</span>, Gates co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend <span>Paul Allen</span> in 1975 in <span>Albuquerque, New Mexico</span>; it went on to become the world's largest <span>personal computer</span> software company. Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, Gates had been <span>criticized for his business tactics</span>, which have been considered <span>anti-competitive</span>. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the <span>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</span>, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, <span>Melinda Gates</span>, established in 2000. He gradually transferred his duties to <span>Ray Ozzie</span> and <span>Craig Mundie</span>.[10] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO <span>Satya Nadella</span>.<br><br>
                        Since 1987, he has been included in the <span><em>Forbes</em> list of the world's wealthiest documented individuals</span>. From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years. In October 2017, he was surpassed by <span>Amazon</span> founder and CEO <span><a href="#Jeff-Bezos" style="text-decoration: none">Jeff Bezos</a></span>, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Gates' net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time. As of November 9, 2019, Gates had an estimated net worth of US$107.1 billion, making him the second wealthiest person in the world, behind Bezos.<br><br>
                        Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the <span>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</span>, reported to be the world's largest <span>private charity</span>. In 2009, Gates and <span>Warren Buffett</span> founded <span>The Giving Pledge</span>, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy. The foundation works to save lives and improve global health, and is working with <span>Rotary International</span> to eliminate <span>polio</span>.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Steven Paul Jobs</strong> (<span>/dʒɒbz/</span>; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American <span>business magnate</span>, <span>industrial designer</span>, <span>investor</span>, and <span>media proprietor</span>. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of <span>Apple Inc.</span>, the chairman and majority shareholder of <span>Pixar</span>, a member of <span>The Walt Disney Company</span>'s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of <span>NeXT</span>. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the <span>personal computer revolution</span> of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder <span>Steve Wozniak</span>.<br><br>
                        Jobs was born in <span>San Francisco</span>, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the <span>San Francisco Bay Area</span>. He attended <span>Reed College</span> in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and <span>traveled through India</span> in 1974 seeking enlightenment and <span>studying Zen Buddhism</span>. His declassified FBI report states that he used <span>marijuana</span> and <span>LSD</span> while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was "one of the two or three most important things" he had done in his life.<br><br>
                        Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's <span>Apple I</span> personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the <span>Apple II</span>, one of the first highly successful mass-produced <span>microcomputers</span>. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the <span>Xerox Alto</span> in 1979, which was <span>mouse</span>-driven and had a <span>graphical user interface</span> (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful <span>Apple Lisa</span> in 1983, followed by the breakthrough <span>Macintosh</span> in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the <span>desktop publishing</span> industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple <span>LaserWriter</span>, the first <span>laser printer</span> to feature <span>vector graphics</span>. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO <span>John Sculley</span>. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found <span>NeXT</span>, a <span>computer platform</span> development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the <span>visual effects</span> industry when he funded the computer graphics division of <span>George Lucas</span>'s <span>Lucasfilm</span> in 1986. The new company was <span>Pixar</span>, which produced the first 3D computer animated film <span><em>Toy Story</em></span> (1995).<br><br>
                        Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with designer <span>Jony Ive</span> to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the "<span>Think different</span>" advertising campaign and leading to the <span>iMac</span>, <span>iTunes</span>, <span>iTunes Store</span>, <span>Apple Store</span>, <span>iPod</span>, <span>iPhone</span>, <span>App Store</span>, and the <span>iPad</span>. In 2001, the original <span>Mac OS</span> was replaced with a completely new <span>Mac OS X</span>, based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a <span>pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor</span> in 2003. He died of <span>respiratory arrest</span> related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong> (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American <span>Christian</span> minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the <span>Civil Rights Movement</span> from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. King is best known for advancing <span>civil rights</span> through <span>nonviolence</span> and <span>civil disobedience</span>, inspired by his <span>Christian</span> beliefs and the nonviolent activism of <span>Mahatma Gandhi</span>.<br><br>
                        King led the 1955 <span>Montgomery bus boycott</span> and later became the first president of the <span>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</span> (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he then led an unsuccessful <span>1962 struggle against segregation</span> in <span>Albany, Georgia</span>, and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in <span>Birmingham, Alabama</span>. He helped organize the 1963 <span>March on Washington</span>, where he delivered his famous "<span>I Have a Dream</span>" speech on the steps of the <span>Lincoln Memorial</span>.<br><br>
                        On October 14, 1964, King won the <span>Nobel Peace Prize</span> for combating <span>racial inequality</span> through <span>nonviolent resistance</span>. In 1965, he helped organize the <span>Selma to Montgomery marches</span>. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards <span>poverty</span> and the <span>Vietnam War</span>. FBI Director <span>J. Edgar Hoover</span> considered him a radical and made him an object of the FBI's <span>COINTELPRO</span> from 1963 on. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and, in 1964, mailed King <span>a threatening anonymous letter</span>, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.<br><br>
                        Before his death, King was planning a national occupation of <span>Washington, D.C.</span>, to be called the <span>Poor People's Campaign</span>, when he was <span>assassinated</span> on April 4 in <span>Memphis, Tennessee</span>. His death was followed by <span>riots in many U.S. cities. Allegations</span> that <span>James Earl Ray</span>, the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting.<br><br>
                        King was posthumously awarded the <span>Presidential Medal of Freedom</span> and the <span>Congressional Gold Medal. Martin Luther King Jr. Day</span> was established as a holiday in cities and states through-out the United States beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President <span>Ronald Reagan</span> in 1986. <span>Hundreds of streets</span> in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and <span>a county</span> in Washington was rededicated for him. <span>The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial</span> on the <span>National Mall</span> in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.
